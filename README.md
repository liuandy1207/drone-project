# drone-project

`dryden3.py`, `OU.py`, and `model_comparison.py` in the `drone_sim` folder run the models.

- `OU.py` runs the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
- `dryden3.py` runs the Dryden Turbulence stochastic.
- `model_comparison.py` runs 500 trials of each and then generates statistic comparisons.

<br>
past work that did not make the final cut is under the `process_work` folder, including

- physics engine visualizaiton for a drone CAD under gravity
- arduino code for gathering roll pitch data from drone testing
